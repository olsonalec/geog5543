# GEOG5543 Advanced Geocomputing, Fall 2024

### Course Description:
The availability of computing infrastructures such as high-performance and cloud computing, highspeed networks, and rich data has led to a new scientific paradigm using computational approaches, termed computational science. Geocomputation is the "application of a computational science paradigm to study a wide range of problems in geographical and earth systems (the geo) contexts" (Openshaw, 2014). This course will delve into advanced topics in geocomputation as well as related areas ranging from geographic information and spatial big data to cyberinfrastructure and parallel computation. Students will engage in hands-on exercises learning principles and best practices in geocomputing while using cutting-edge computational infrastructures.

### Unit 1: Cyberinfrastructure
### Unit 2: Geospatial AI and Analytics
### Unit 3: Parallel Computing
### Final: Final Project

For each of the three units, I developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using the skills associated with that unit. The Final Project was a collaborative effort with another student in the class. We built upon our MVPs to build a more comprehensive project.
