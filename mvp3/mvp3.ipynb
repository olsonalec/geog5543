{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Real-time Search for Similar Weather in Different Locations on Earth\n","The final iteration of this project is a program that will tell the user what city on Earth currently has the most similar weather conditions compared to the user's location. The user will enter the name of their current city, and then the program will look at the weather conditions of thousands of cities across the globe to determine which one is most similar. It will calculate a \"similarity index\" for each city, with a lower index indicating more similar weather. Then, the program will return the name of the city that has the lowest index to the user, as well as the weather conditions in that city compared to the weather conditions in the user's city.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ARx6ZCl4BaoL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 0.\n","Import required modules"],"metadata":{"id":"Exewfg1FPOqN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import requests\n","import time\n","from multiprocessing import Pool"],"metadata":{"id":"x_s16rtSy-md"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.\n","Get the current temperature, relative humidity, windspeed, and sky condition (clear or not clear) in Minneapolis.\\\n","Convert the sky condition (which is initially a string) into 0 (clear) or 1 (not clear) so that it can be quantitatively compared to the rest of the weather data."],"metadata":{"id":"5eL6nYouPH52"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["current_time = time.asctime()   # this is recorded as UTC\n","\n","mpls = requests.get('https://api.weather.gov/stations/KANE/observations/latest')\n","mpls = mpls.json()\n","mplsTemp = mpls['properties']['temperature']['value']\n","mplsHumidity = mpls['properties']['relativeHumidity']['value']\n","mplsWindspeed = mpls['properties']['windSpeed']['value']\n","mplsSkyCondition = mpls['properties']['textDescription']\n","if 'Clear' in mplsSkyCondition:\n","  mplsSkyConditionIndex = 0\n","else:\n","  mplsSkyConditionIndex = 1"],"metadata":{"id":"XzTtVbe_PFu2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2.\n","Get a list of NOAA zones in the U.S.\\\n","Iterate through the zones and grab the Observation Stations (from which we can grab current weather data).\\\n","Remove duplicates from the list of Observation Stations."],"metadata":{"id":"53-Lmdl6PTiM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["zones = requests.get('https://api.weather.gov/zones?type=land')\n","zones = zones.json()\n","\n","stations = []\n","for i in range(len(zones['features'])):\n","    if zones['features'][i]['properties']['state'] != 'MN':         # exclude MN weather stations from comparison\n","        zoneID = zones['features'][i]['properties']['id']\n","        observationStations = zones['features'][i]['properties']['observationStations']\n","        if observationStations != []:\n","            station = observationStations[0][33:]\n","            stations.append(station)\n","\n","stations = list(set(stations))"],"metadata":{"id":"87n9x5V7PZD9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 3.\n","Function to request weather data from a NOAA Observation Station.

First of all, my MVP uses Minneapolis as the starting city and will only compare cities within the U.S. This allows me to only worry about gathering data from one source: the NOAA. Additionally, although I will be comparing four parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, windspeed, and sky condition) when calculating a 'similarity score' for each location, the way in which these parameters are combined to create the 'similarity score' is not scientific. For example, I have simplified the sky condition parameter to be a binary 0 (clear skies) or 1 (not clear skies). This MVP does not distinguish among clouds, rain, snow, or fog; rather, it classifies all those conditions as 'not clear'."],"metadata":{"id":"VL1BiZ2xB4-y"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
